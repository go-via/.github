# ⚡ Go-Via

> Home of **Via** — the engine for building fully reactive, real-time web applications in pure Go.

Via lets you build rich, reactive web applications **entirely in Go** — no JavaScript, no templating, no build steps.  
It unifies frontend interactivity and backend logic under one language and runtime.

### 📦 What’s inside

- **[via](https://github.com/go-via/via)** — The core engine: pages, components, actions, and reactive signals.  
- *(coming soon)* `v0.1.0` will introduce support for plugins, an example real-time dashboard with sub-second updates, and a ready-to-use starter template.

### 🚀 Why Via?

Because web development with Javascript frameworks and complex build chains can be exausting — and Go developers slould never have build a separate frontend in a different language.  

Via brings **real-time data**, **live reactivity**, **type safety**, and **simplicity** to the browser — all powered by Go, with [Datastar]('https://data-star.dev') and [Gomponents]('https://maragu.dev/gomponents') under the hood.

You write Go code for everything: define your web UIs, state, actions and reacive signals — and Via helps you to keep your UI perfectly sync, instantly and efficiently.

### 🧭 Vision

To make web applications in Go **reactive, real-time, and free from frontend complexity**, while staying close to the Go’s philosophy of simplicity, clarity and control.

Stay tuned for updates.
