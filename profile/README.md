**Go-Via** is the home of **[Via]('https://github.com/go-via/via')** — 
A modern engine for building **rich, real-time, reactive web applications entirely in Go** 

Via unifies frontend interactivity and backend logic under one language and runtime. No JavaScript. No templating languages. No build chains. Just Go.

### 📦 What’s inside

- **[via](https://github.com/go-via/via)** — The core engine: pages, components, actions, and reactive signals.
- Plugins for Via:
  - **[via-plugin-picocss](https://github.com/go-via/via-plugin-picocss)** — Integrates [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/) library to apply a minimal and beautiful CSS style to every plain HTML element. Comes with options for choosing a color theme from a set of available [themes](https://picocss.com/docs/version-picker), and enabling a bundle of CSS [color classes](https://picocss.com/docs/colors) with multiple shades to style individual elements.
    
- *(coming soon)*:
  - Plugins: Apache ECharts, Maplibre Gl (libre version of Mapbox GL), and more. 
  - Real-time dashboard example with sub-second updates.
  - CLI tool for easy dev workflow:
    - `via init` — bootstrap a new Via project.
    - `via dev` to run your app in dev mode with intant reload on save (just like air-verse/air).
    - `via build` to build the application.

- *(comming eventually)*:
  - **Via Cloud** and `via deploy` CLI command to boostrap a `via-deploy.yml` manifest and deploy the application to a production-ready environment optimized for containerized workloads, including automatic provisioning of all required sidecar services, environment settings, and deployment policies.


### 🚀 Why Via?

Web development with Javascript frameworks and complex build chains is not the *only* option.

Things used to be simple. 

Things can be simple again.

Via brings **real-time data**, **live reactivity**, **type safety**, and **simplicity** to the browser — all powered by Go, with **[Datastar](https://data-star.dev)** and **[Gomponents](https://maragu.dev/gomponents)** under the hood.

You write Go code for everything: define your web UIs, state, actions and reacive signals — and Via helps you to keep your UI perfectly sync, instantly and efficiently.

### 🧭 Vision

To make web applications in Go **reactive, real-time, and free from frontend complexity**, while staying close to the Go’s philosophy of simplicity, clarity and control.
