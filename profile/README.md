**Go-Via** is the home of **[Via]('https://github.com/go-via/via')** — 
A modern engine for building **rich, real-time, reactive web applications entirely in Go** 

Via unifies frontend interactivity and backend logic under one language and runtime. No JavaScript. No templating languages. No build chains. Just Go.

### 📦 What’s inside

- **[via](https://github.com/go-via/via)** — The core engine: pages, components, actions, and reactive signals.  
- *(coming soon)* `v0.1.0` will introduce support for plugins, an example real-time dashboard with sub-second updates, and a ready-to-use starter template.

### 🚀 Why Via?

Because web development with Javascript frameworks and complex build chains can be exausting — and because Go developers deserve a simple tool to build go-native modern frontends with full reactivity for their apps. And now, they can.

Via brings **real-time data**, **live reactivity**, **type safety**, and **simplicity** to the browser — all powered by Go, with **[Datastar](https://data-star.dev)** and **[Gomponents](https://maragu.dev/gomponents)** under the hood.

You write Go code for everything: define your web UIs, state, actions and reacive signals — and Via helps you to keep your UI perfectly sync, instantly and efficiently.

### 🧭 Vision

To make web applications in Go **reactive, real-time, and free from frontend complexity**, while staying close to the Go’s philosophy of simplicity, clarity and control.

Stay tuned for updates.
